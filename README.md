# Netflix Clone

I designed and developed a Netflix clone application that seamlessly integrates with the TMDB (The Movie Database) Web API, highlighting my expertise in front-end web development and proficiency in utilizing external APIs.

Using React's powerful component-based architecture, I built a responsive and interactive web application that closely resembles the popular streaming platform, Netflix. By leveraging the TMDB API, I fetched a vast array of movie and TV show data, ensuring that the application's content was always up to date and relevant.

# Technologies used:

- React
- React Router: Implemented smooth navigation and routing between different pages of the application, providing a seamless user experience.
- CSS frameworks: Utilized popular CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap to ensure responsive design, consistent styling, and improved user interface.
- RESTful APIs: Integrated external APIs, such as the TMDB (The Movie Database) API, to fetch movie and TV show data, enabling users to access a vast library of content.

# Key features implemented in the Netflix clone:

- Content Display: Fetched and displayed a wide range of movie and TV show data, including titles, descriptions, genres, ratings, and release dates.
- Filtering and Sorting: Implemented filtering and sorting options, enabling users to explore content based on genres, ratings, or release dates, and providing a customized browsing experience.
- Search Functionality: Integrated a search feature that allowed users to find specific titles quickly, improving the application's usability.
- Watchlist: Implemented a feature that enabled users to create personalized watchlists, allowing them to save their favorite movies and TV shows for later viewing.
- Recently Watched: Developed a section that displayed the user's viewing history, providing easy access to previously watched content and enabling seamless continuation of playback.
- Responsive Design: Ensured the application's responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes, creating an optimal viewing experience for users on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
